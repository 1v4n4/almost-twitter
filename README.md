# Twitter clone, Ruby on Rails project

> Twitter clone, the project based on Odin and Web-Crunch Ruby on Rails curriculum, enables users to sign in/ sign up and then create tweets. Users can see all posts but they can edit only posts they created. Also, they can edit only their account information and passwords. 
Guests who aren't logged in can see only a list of posts and list other users of Twitter clone. The focus is on functionality, and that's why the layout is very basic. Gem Devise is used for user authentication.
